Java is one of the most popular programming languages around, but no one seems to enjoy using it. 
Well, Java is actually an alright programming language, and since Java 17 came out recently, I decided to compile a list of libraries, practices, 
and tools to make using Java better. "Better" is subjective, so I would recommend taking the parts that speak to you and use them, rather than 
trying to use all of them at once. Feel free to submit pull requests suggesting additions.
